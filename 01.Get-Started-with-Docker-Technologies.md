### 01. Get Started with Docker Technologies

- [Back to README](./README.md)

#### Check your docker info
```
docker info
```
#### Check what docker images you have installed
```
docker images
```
#### Run docker image
```
docker run busybox:latest echo "Hello World"
```
#### Check docker folder
```
docker run busybox ls /
```
#### If you want to run cli inside of your container
```
docker run -i -t busybox
```
#### Run docker in background
```
docker run -d busybox sleep 1000
```
#### Check what is running
```
docker ps
```
#### Check all previous docker containers that were running
```
docker ps -a
```
#### If you want to automatically remove docker image after some time
```
docker run --rm busybox sleep 1
```
#### If you want to give your docker some name for this container name
```
docker run --name hello_world busybox
```
#### This way you can inspect your container image system properties
```
docker run -d busybox sleep 1000
docker inspect <container id>
```
#### Install and run tomcat image on your docker.
```
docker run -it -p 8888:8080 tomcat:8.0
```
#### You can run docker image in detached mode.
```
docker run -it -d -p 8888:8080 tomcat:8.0
```
#### You can check your docker logs.
```
docker logs <container id>
```
