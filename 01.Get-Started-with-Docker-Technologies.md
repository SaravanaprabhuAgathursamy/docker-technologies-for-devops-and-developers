### 01. Get Started with Docker Technologies

- check your docker info
- ```docker info```
- check what docker images you have installed
- ```docker images```
- run docker image
- ```docker run busybox:latest echo "Hello World"```
- check docker folder
- ```docker run busybox ls /```
- if you want to run cli inside of your container
- ```docker run -i -t busybox```
- run docker in background
- ```docker run -d busybox sleep 1000```
- check what is running
- ```docker ps```
- check all previous docker containers that were running
- ```docker ps -a```
- if you want to automatically remove docker image after some time
- ```docker run --rm busybox sleep 1```
- if you want to give your docker some name for this container name
- ```docker run --name hello_world busybox```
- This way you can inspect your container image system properties
- ```docker run -d busybox sleep 1000```
- ```docker inspect <container id>```
- Install and run tomcat image on your docker.
- ```docker run -it -p 8888:8080 tomcat:8.0```
- You can run docker image in detached mode.
- ```docker run -it -d -p 8888:8080 tomcat:8.0```
- You can check your docker logs.
- ```docker logs <container id>```
