#### Deploy two VMs, one will be used for the Swam manager node, and the other one will be used as a worker node.
#### Initialize swarm cluster.
```
docker swarm init --advertise-addr <public-ip>
```
#### Let the second VM join the Swarm cluster as a worker node
```
docker swarm join
docker swarm leave
```
#### Docker supports load balancing. Docker can restart containers.

docker stack deploy --compose-file prod.yml prod.yml 
docker stack ls
docker stack services docker_stack_app
docker-machine ls
